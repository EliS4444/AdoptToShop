# AdoptToShop
By: Eli Sokolow
The Adopt to Shop App is an individual project where I have built an ASP.NET Web App that enables users to view, and adopt a pet from an online database.

The app consists of a database with tables for:

Animals
Adopters
Adoptions
In Version 1.0 (MVP), users will have the ability to:

View all pets in the current database
View each pet individually, identifying their breed, sex, age, if they are spayed or not, and a description
Fill out an adoption application
Add personal information to their user profile
Endpoints have been implemented using RESTful API implementation.

The main goal of this exercise is to gain practice using:

MVC Applications
Deploying to Github
Using self implemented error correcting tactics
